It's time to go make something awesome, on us.

The world is filled with developers, hackers, devops people and more - you are
the bread and butter of the tech world. Each day you get up and thinking of
new, amazing, awesome things and put your imagination and skills to work.

Maybe you're building the next [SaltStack][9] or [Ansible][10]. Maybe a new
realtime web application framework that builds the elasticity of the cloud.
Could you be building a beautiful abstraction like [Docker][11], sharing
platform, encrypted communications service? Maybe you just want to add support
for [OpenStack][1] to your cloud based tool or project?

You could just want to scratch an itch or chase something you feel passionate
about and simply need a place to build and deploy it. Regardless of what you
make, or want to make. The creativity of you is what makes our developer
world sublime should be celebrated and encouraged.

*Today we're pleased to offer a new **$300 over six months** Developer
Discount program in the US and UK.*

Sign up at for a **new** Rackspace Cloud account in the US or UK at
[developer.rackspace.com/devtrial][8], and your account is automatically
credited up to 50$ (30Â£ UK) for 6 months. Note that anything above 50$, and
you are responsible for the cost, otherwise: it's on us. It's simple, and
automatic.

Rackspace is dedicated to making developer lives easier and we're passionate
about supporting collaborative open source projects and communities.

Explore what you can do on the world's largest open-source, [OpenStack][1]
based cloud. Give us your feedback on our array of open source,
[multi-cloud tools][2].

Give [vagrant-rackspace][3] a spin, or try out [rumm][4] - a powerful little
command line tool. Explore our open source tools and projects (check
out [github.com/rackspace][6][github.com/rackerlabs][5]). We look forward to
hearing your thoughts and feedback.

Call, [email][7] or join us on IRC (irc.freenode.net, #rackspace).

Go forth and make something awesome. Talk about it; blog about it - put it
on Github and share it with the world. Remember - we not only
[respect you and your data][12] - we will always fight for you.
